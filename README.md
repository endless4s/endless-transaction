# endless-transaction

endless-transaction is a Scala library that provides a functional abstraction for distributed transactions based on cats-effect and the endless library. It is designed to simplify the process of coordinating transactions using the two-phase commit protocol. Transactions are implemented with persistent entities using event-sourcing, making the system resilient to failures.
